This morning we discussed the details of Scrum. Currently, we have decided that the first Sprint will focus on **creating the POC for the entire project**. Therefore, our top priorities at the moment are as follows:

- [ ] Understand the Scrum process. I will supply some Scrum resources for everyone to reference.
- [ ] Explore the scope of deliverables further. We need to determine the specific goals for each Sprint.
- [ ] Each team member should brainstorm User Stories for each topic (Model, Data, Test, Cloud Infra, Demo Platform). Please try to complete this by Wednesday (2024/03/27) so that we can define the User Stories for this Sprint.
- [ ] Once we have defined the User Stories, we need to assign each person their responsibilities and tasks. Ideally, we should start this on Thursday (2024/03/28).
- [ ] We need to discuss a fixed daily sync time for everyone to track progress and ensure it aligns with the Sprint's progress.
- [ ] We need to plan the entire project workflow, including Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective, and how to ensure the project stays on schedule.

Above of all, our next meeting time is Wednesday (2024/03/27), if there is detail information, I will update it in the group chat.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I will do my best to assist you.
