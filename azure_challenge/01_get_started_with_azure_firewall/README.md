# Get Start with Azure Firewall
### Overview
We always want to limit the inbound and outbound traffic of our environment for protecting the service and the data. The firewall is the best choice for us the filter and blocks the traffic from the internet. Using the firewall we can customize the policy that we want to limit the traffic. In Azure, we can use the Azure firewall to achieve the goal.

The Azure Firewall is the intelligent network firewall security service. It can protect your Azure environment. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create the virtual wan
- Create the vitrual network and the virtual machine
- Create an Azure firewall in virtual wan
- Create the firewall policy for filtering the traffic

### Create Virtual Network

`Subnet Address Range` -> `IP Address Range` + `Size`

### Create Virtual WAN

`Specify number of Public IP addresses`


To find the firewall
1. goto Virtual Hub
2. security
3. scroll down to create a firewall

Firewall IP Configuration:
- public: `52.167.214.194`
- private: `10.0.64.4`


### Virtual Machine 1
```bash
ssh <your vm1 user name>@<your firewall public IP>
```

```bash
$ ssh hugolin@52.167.214.194
